# Project Description
Our project for the APAC HPC AI Competition 2025 focuses on the implementation and optimization of NWChem and DeepSeek-SGLang on the NCI Gadi and NSCC Aspire2p SG supercomputers.

# Objectives
The objective is to leverage these advanced computational tools and high-performance computing resources to solve complex problems in quantum chemical molecular dynamics (NWChem) and large language model (DeepSeek) efficiently, with a primary focus on achieving maximum optimization.

# Optimization Method
### NWChem
* Implementation of fast storage
* Application of OpenMP and MPI (Hybrid Parallelization)
* Changes in input file

### DeepSeek-SGLang
* NCCL communication tuning
* CUDA efficiency settings
* Warm-up execution

# Results
[HOOMD Blue]
* Steps per second increased when more nodes and cores are used. This reflects on the improved performance with additional computational resources
* 

# Challenges
Discuss any challenges or obstacles faced during the project and how they were addressed.

# Conclusion
Summarize the key findings and outcomes of your project.
